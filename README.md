## Edx Capstone - Airbnb Analysis Report
Airbnb, Inc. is an online marketplace that offers accommodation and entertainment. The company does not have a real estate list, and does not host events; acts as a reseller, earning commissions from each booking. The service was launched in 2008 with 2 hosts and 3 guests. Its number one concern ensures the safety of its customers while providing an enjoyable experience.

I have performed descriptive and critical data analysis, in order to understand how each of the variables behaves individually and dynamically. To do this task, I will use the most common mathematical techniques for any type of analysis, simple or complex, such as variable variables, frequency distribution tables, histograms, intermediate inclination measures and more.

I also did an analysis by predicting the price of the Airbnb list as a suggestion for experts.

The models I have used here are Linear Regression, Partial Least-Squares Regression (PLS),
Enhanced Normal Line Model, Repeated Trees and Reversal Trees, Shaved Tree Models, Bound Carriage, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Boosting Strength, KNN, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression and Support Vector Regression.
