## Edx Capstone - Airbnb Analysis Report
Airbnb, Inc. is an online marketplace for offering lodging,homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking. This service has started in 2008 with 2 hosts and 3 travellers. Its number one concern is assuring safety of its customers while providing enjoyable experiences.
I performed a descriptive and exploratory analysis of the data, in order to understand how the phenomena of each variable behave individually and transversely. To perform this work, I will use statistical techniques very common in any type of analysis, simple or complex, such as classification of variables, frequency distribution tables, histograms, measures of central tendency and etc.
I have also done analysis on predicting the price of Airbnb listings as a suggestion for the hosts.
The models I have applied here are Linear Regression , Partial Least-Squares Regression (PLS), Boosted Generalized Linear Model ,Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees, Pruned Tree Models, Bagged CART ,Random Forest ,Stochastic Gradient Boosting ,KNN ,Ridge Regression ,Lasso Regression and Support Vector Regression
